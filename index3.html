    <h1 id="HISTORY">HISTORY</h1>
    <p>The Eastern Chalukyas ruled coastal Andhra Pradesh from 700 to 1200 CE, with their capital in Vengi. Historical evidence of their rule has been found in the nearby villages of Pedavegi and Guntupalli (Jilakarragudem). Eluru then became a part of the Kalinga Empire until 1471 CE before conquest by the Gajapati Empire. In 1515 CE, Sri Krishna Deva Raya captured it. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Kingdom, it was ruled by the Qutb Shahi Dynasty's Sultans of Golkonda.[9] On 15 April 1925, the West Godavari District was formed with Bhimavaram as its headquarters, and all of the district offices and regional offices were centralised in Eluru.[10]

During the Madras Presidency in 1823, the District of Rajahmundry was created.[11] It was reorganised in 1859 and bifurcated into the Godavari and Krishna districts.[12][13] Kakinada became the headquarters of the Godavari district, which was further bifurcated into the East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925.[14] When the Godavari district was divided, Eluru became the headquarters of West Godavari. After the 4 April 2022 bifurcation for a separate Eluru district, Bhimavaram became the new headquarters of the West Godavari district.
